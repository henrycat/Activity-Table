Activity Table
--------------
I followed this tutorial: https://scotch.io/tutorials/sort-and-filter-a-table-using-angular

What I wanted to do was create a table that can be sorted by activity type, season and ratings. Of course this can be modified and perfected. This way a user can find the activity that appeals to them, so for a example if they are looking for a kids friendly activity in winter they can find it.
